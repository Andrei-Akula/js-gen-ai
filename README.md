# GenAI Practical Application Development using JavaScript

## Intro
Before you begin, create an API key in the dashboard, which you'll use to securely access the API. Store the key in a safe location, like a .zshrc
file or another text file on your computer. Once you've generated an API key, export it as an environment variable in your terminal.

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```
